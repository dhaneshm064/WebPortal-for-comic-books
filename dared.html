Daredevil is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Daredevil was created by writer-editor Stan Lee and artist Bill Everett, with an unspecified amount of input from Jack Kirby.[1] The character first appeared in Daredevil #1 (April 1964).
Daredevil's origin story relates that while living in the historically gritty or crime-ridden, working class Irish-American neighborhood of Hell's Kitchen in New York City, Matt Murdock is blinded by a radioactive substance that falls from a truck after he pushes a man to safety from the oncoming vehicle. While he no longer can see, the radioactive exposure heightens his remaining senses beyond normal human ability and gives him a "radar sense". His father, a boxer named Jack Murdock, supports him as he grows up, though Jack is later killed by gangsters after refusing to throw a fight. After donning a yellow and dark red costume (later all dark red), Matt seeks out revenge against his father's killers as the superhero Daredevil, fighting against his many enemies, including Bullseye and Kingpin.[2] He also becomes a lawyer after having graduated from law school with his best friend and roommate, Franklin "Foggy" Nelson. Daredevil is also commonly known by such epithets as the Man Without Fear[3] and the Devil of Hell's Kitchen.[4]
